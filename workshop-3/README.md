# Flappy Bird AI: Workshop 3: Building an AI to Learn the Game
The past couple weeks we've built a flappy bird game with pygame that we can play on our computer by clicking the spacebar. Today we're going to 
1. download a new skeleton file with some of those features removed, so that we can build an AI that will learn the game. Then, 
2. we're going to talk about neural networks, and genetic algorithms
3. we're going to write the code that will have an AI learn our game



## Setup
First, download the file in this directory called `flappy_bird_ai.py`. If you've done the previous workshops I recommend keeping your other flappy bird code in another file, so make sure they don't have the same name or this new one will overwrite it.

If you did miss the previous workshops, double check you have `pygame` installed with the setup instructions in [Workshop 1](https://github.com/gdscwm/flappy-bird-ai-workshop/tree/main/workshop-1). Also download the `imgs` folder from any workshop's folder in this repository, or the link in workshop 1's instructions.

### NEAT
Next, we're going to install a python library called `NEAT`, by running 
```
pip install neat
```
just like how we installed `pygame` in the first workshop.


## What is NEAT?
Now let's talk about NEAT, and neural networks in general.
