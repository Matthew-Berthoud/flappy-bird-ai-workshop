# Flappy Bird AI Workshop Series

In this series, we build a clone of the game Flappy Bird, and then write an AI to play the game for us. Workshops one and two deal with writing the game, and the remaining workshops build the AI. 
Navigate through the directories above to find follow-along instructions in the READMEs, and completed code after each workshop.
